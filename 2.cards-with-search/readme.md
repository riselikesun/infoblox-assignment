## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **File Structure**:

index.html loades all the js and cs files.

- cardHandler.js has all logic related to rendering the cards
- data.js has all static data about the cards (no backend or db)
- getFilteredData.js handles all the data query
- index.js combines everything to work
